# My Runs
An Android app used to track running activities data

## What can it do?
1) You can manually input a running session with speed, distance, date, length, calories burned with Manual Mode
2) You can let the app tracks and automatically calculates all the data and save it once you are done with the session with GPS Mode
3) You can let the app guess which activity you are currently doing and calculates the data with Automatic Mode
4) All of the previous activity sessions will be stored on device storage

## How do I use the app
1) Clone the repository
2) Build the APK by doing Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK (s) > Build APK (s)
3) Install the APK on an Android phone with a minimum SDK version of 26 (Android 8.0)
4) Allows app permissions (Automatic and GPS mode will not without location permission, and you can not change or upload photo without camera/storage permision)
5) Use the app
